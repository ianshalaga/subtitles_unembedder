You mean, there are six more?

46
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,240
In that old building.

47
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,033

51
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,509

Yeah; we don't know his identity,

55
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,768
But the rumor says he lives in the old building:

56
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,816

Kindaichi Hajime; the trash of the human beings;

70
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,862
heard he got a zero in math again:

71
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,490
It's hard to believe he's a childhood friend with Miyuki; one of the best students in school

72
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,452
Hajime-chan; here.

73

If I always do it, it won't help Hajime-chan

126
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,006
No one can read this.

127

The code that Sakuragi-senpai left.

128
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,469
She said, if you don't know what this means,

129
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,930
You cannot participate in the club camp this time.

130
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,355
It's just some prank that sheset up

131
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,482
This is just nonsense, for sure.

132
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,278
What, this is just club camp schedule_

133
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,958

That's great; Hajime-chan!

138
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,948
Using matches as a multiplication symbol is the huh? key,

139
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,409
easy! Easy,

140
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,496
Good job, Kindaichi-kun.

141
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,499
That's stupid.

142
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,334
That's just pure luck

143
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:09,257
He's the grandson of the famous detective, Kindaichi Kousuke_

144
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,678
He's also a genius with an IQ of 180

145
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,056
He has an IQ of 180?!

146
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,726
Anyhow, let's start the club meeting

147
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:25,690
Today s theme is the rumored Seven Mysteries of Fudoh Academy's old school building.

148
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,650
You mean, the one that if you find out the seventh secret,

149
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,945
You'l be killed by afterschool conjurer?

150
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,989
That afterschool conjurer,

151
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,575
Sent a threat letter to the Principal.

152
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,997
A threat letter from the afterschool conjurer?

153
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:48,463
You all know that we're trying to It saytear down the old school building;right? hed,

3 =

155
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,632
The seven mysteries will repeat again.

156
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,384
If the old school building is demolished 

157
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:52,509

158
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:53,802
The curse..

159
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:58,598
Why send such threat?" That is our theme

160
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,893
And our Mystery Research Club will solve all the problems,

161
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,397
Of course, we'll uncover the Seventh Mystery as well.

162
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,150
Well, as a guidance teacher in the Mystery Research Club,

163
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,360
I'd like to say something

164
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,903

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,915
That doesnitsound like words coming from the physics teacher.

168
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,667
But, the problems _

169
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,461
You mean, you'll be responsible for anything,

170
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:29,671

If that was really your work,

195
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:08,603
Then it'd be wonderful

196
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,660

00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,003
This building is really unstable.

209
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,095

Sakuragi-senpai,

215
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,618
Why does she get close to me so much?

216
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,870
By any chance, am | sexy?

217
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,830
Hajime-chan, you are-

218
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,670

I'll show you something interesting

226
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,279
It was just like my deduction.

227
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,450
But | didn't think it'd be such a secret. scary

228
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,247
He'll be shocked.

229
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,550
The last of the seven mysteries.

230
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,301
wonder if she' s okay .

231
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,555
The rumor says, you'll be killed by afterschool conjurer if you find that out.

232
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,975
That s just made-up

233
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,352
It's creepy; the school at night.

234
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,857
Itwas the prinhngeron Inold days

235
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,318
The second of seven mysteries is here

236
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,488
In old days,

237
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,992
A male student cut his hand off with the cutting machine in this printing room-

238
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,245
He died due to loss of blood

239
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,372
But after that,

240
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,043
No matter how much everyone looked, his severed hand went missing.

241
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,214
Ever since; the sound of the hand creeping around at night 

242
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,097
What, Hajime-chan?

243
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,266
Just now, heard something weird.

244
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,684
No,

245
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,394

248
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,324
Really! Hajime-chan!

249
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:51,701
Hmm?

250
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:52,911
It's dark.

251
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,475
You were called here too?

252
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,352
By that weird phone call?

253
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,813
You really surprised me.

254
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,440
I'm sorry, was about to turn on the lights,

255
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,401
However, you guys came in just then.

256
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,820
You are all here by Sakuragi-senpai's call?

257
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,614
Mine was a weird male voice

258
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,951
It said, There will be a death ritual at 10 0'clock, s0 come

259
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,203

Don't say anything scary.

00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:53,638
I'm taking a look around.

267
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,098
You guys; g0 home.

268
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:56,850
Is it okay to be with you?

269
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:58,601
Hajime-chan.

270
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,271
have a weird premonition

271
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,565
Everyone; wait here.

272
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,946
Well, why don't we patrol around the old school building instead of here?

273
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,781
feel something might happen.. like

274
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,410
Don't worry, you can see the old school building from this new building.

275
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,248
Now that / look at it this way, it does look really old.

276
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,417
It'Il be torn down soon

277
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:24,502
There's light 

278
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:25,378
That's strange_

279
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,714
That light is coming from the forbidden biology room.

280
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,299
No one should be able to enter.

281
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,218
The forbidden biology room?

282
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,064
That's?!

283
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,358
Sakuragi-senpai?!

284
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,155
W-what?

285
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,909
Senpai!

286
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:56,993
I'm sure of it.

287
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:58,161
It's the biology room:

288
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:07,587
It won't open!

289
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:08,421
Where's the key?

290
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,799
It's called the "forbidden" biology room because there's no key.

291
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:11,508
Damn.

292
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:15,595
Makabe-senpai,

293
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,181
In this room, Sakuragi-senpai was hanged _

294
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,891
By the afterschool conjurer!

295
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,976
The afterschool conjurer?!

296
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,186

297
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:23,687
22

298
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,605
What's going on?

299
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,691
Hajime-chan, what's going on?

300
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,902

The body and the candles..

304
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:56,845
That can't be!

305
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,388
Isaw it with my own eyes!

306
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,640
All the windows are locked

307
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:02,976
He didn't exit through the windows.

308
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,895
Then; the thing we saw_

309
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,690
What's wrong, everyone?

310
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,527
Somehow, doesn't this resemble the Seven Mysteries?

311
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:13,945
7

312
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:17,532
The disappearance of a hanged body from the forbidden biology room_

313
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,582
Don't say stuff like that. It can't be good omen_

314
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:44,184
Hey; I think l understand what happened last night.

315
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,063
It was just a prank by Sakuragi-senpai.

316
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,483
Shesaid she would show you something interesting; right?

317
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,818
hope that's the case

318
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,073

00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,282
Miyuki!

320
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,243
